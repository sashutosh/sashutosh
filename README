Hi

I am polyglot programmer started my career from writing code for embedded controllers and graduated to enterprise cloud native applications touching everything on the spectrum in between in the journey. 

Can easily slide from developer to technical lead to architect based on need of the product and team.

Currently developing Java based microservices for on-premise and cloud based multi-tenant enterprise products. 

Loves solving performance challenges, memory leaks and interacting with customer to understand unmet needs.

A newbie AI/ML enthusiast.

Sometimes I answer questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/694143/asolanki)

Strong believer in continuous learning and keeping up with technological trends, some of the online courses I completed.
